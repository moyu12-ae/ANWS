## ⚡ What is this?

**Anws** — A **structured workflow framework** for Agentic AI assistants, designed to solve the core pain points of the Vibe Coding era.

> 💡 **TL;DR**: Stop letting AI write spaghetti code. Force it to think like an architect first.

### ANWS

**Axiom — principle before implementation.**  
**Nexus — connection before fragmentation.**  
**Weave — coherence before accumulation.**  
**Sovereignty — human judgment before automation.**

**Works with**: Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf.

### 🎯 Problems We Solve

| Pain Point             | The Problem                                                 | Our Solution                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture Drift** | AI generates inconsistent patterns across the same codebase | `/genesis` forces PRD & architecture design first              |
| **Spaghetti Code**     | AI lacks project context, writes code that doesn't fit      | Tasks include constraints & acceptance criteria                |
| **Context Amnesia**    | New session = AI forgets all previous decisions             | `AGENTS.md` + versioned docs as persistent memory |
| **Lack of Planning**   | Vibe Coding skips design, creates tech debt                 | Mandatory design-first workflow                                |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A — npm CLI (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @haaaiawd/anws
cd your-project
anws init
```

> Requires Node.js ≥ 18.

### Option B — GitHub Release

Download the latest `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Haaaiawd/Anws/releases), then copy `.agents/` to your project root.

### 📦 Update Existing Installation

```bash
cd your-project
anws update
```

> `anws update --check` prints file-level and content-level diff previews without writing files.
> `anws update` overwrites managed workflow/skill files to the latest version, and handles `AGENTS.md` via merge / migrate / skip rules:
> - marker-based `AGENTS.md` → update stable sections while preserving the `AUTO` block
> - recognized legacy `AGENTS.md` → migrate into the new marker-based structure
> - unrecognized legacy `AGENTS.md` → warn and preserve unchanged
> If your project still has a legacy `.agent/` directory, the CLI will ask whether to migrate to `.agents/`.
> After a successful legacy migration in interactive mode, the CLI can also ask whether to delete the old `.agent/` directory.

### Your First Project 🐣

> **The easiest way to start**: Just run the `/quickstart` command! The AI will automatically analyze your project state and guide you step-by-step through the entire lifecycle (from `/genesis` to `/forge`).

**Looking for inspiration? Alternative prompt**: "I want to build a web-based macOS simulator, including Dock, top bar, and several system apps. Please start this new project from scratch according to the development process."

### 🔁 Built with Itself (Dogfooding)

Fun fact: **This very CLI tool (`anws`) was built using its own workflows!**
We used the `/genesis` workflow to design the CLI's architecture, and the `/forge` workflow to implement the code. This project serves as a live demonstration of what Anws can achieve.

**Deep Thinking & Architecture Design**: The AI will automatically execute the `/genesis` workflow, thinking deeply about project requirements and producing the PRD and architecture design.

**Interactive Requirement Alignment**: The AI will ask follow-up questions for ambiguous requirements to ensure the design matches your intuition.

**Autonomous Task Breakdown & Execution**: The AI will autonomously call necessary Skills (e.g., `spec-writer`, `task-planner`, etc.) to complete documentation and task decomposition.

## 🔑 Core Principles

### 1. Versioned Architecture
> Don't "fix" architecture docs. **Evolve** them.

- `.anws/v1` → `.anws/v2` on major changes
- Full traceability of decisions
- No "it was always like this" mystery

### 2. Deep Thinking First
> AI must think before it writes.

- Workflows force multi-step reasoning via the built-in `sequential-thinking` skill
- `[!IMPORTANT]` blocks as guardrails
- No shallow, scan-and-output responses

### 3. Filesystem as Memory
> Chat is ephemeral. Files are eternal.

- `AGENTS.md` = AI's anchor
- Architecture docs = persistent decisions
- New session recovery in 30 seconds

## 📋 Workflows

| Command           | Purpose                                                 | Input             | Output                                     |

| `/genesis`        | Start from zero, create PRD & architecture              | Vague idea        | PRD, Architecture, ADRs                    |
| `/probe`         | Analyze legacy codebase risks                           | Existing code     | Risk report, Gap analysis                  |

## 🛠️ Compatibility & Prerequisites

> ⚠️ **Important**: This framework works with any AI coding tool that reads `AGENTS.md` and supports `.agents/` directory structure.

| Environment     |            Status            | Notes                          |
| --------------- | :--------------------------: | ------------------------------ |
| **Windsurf**       |     ✅ Full Support      | Native `.agents/workflows/` + slash commands |
| **Claude Code**    |     ✅ Full Support      | Reads `AGENTS.md` + workflows via instructions |
| **GitHub Copilot** |     ✅ Full Support      | `AGENTS.md` + `.github/instructions/` + skills |
| **Cursor**         |     ✅ Supported        | Via `.cursor/rules/` + `AGENTS.md` |
| **Others**         |     ✅ Compatible       | Any tool that reads `AGENTS.md` |

**How it works**: Anws uses `AGENTS.md` as the universal anchor point. Each tool reads this file to understand project context and workflow locations. The `.agents/` directory contains workflows and skills that can be discovered and executed.

### ✅ Built-in Deep Reasoning Support

This framework includes a built-in `sequential-thinking` skill for structured deep reasoning.

- No separate MCP installation is required for the core reasoning path
- Workflows and skills now use a unified `sequential-thinking` calling convention
- The built-in examples cover revision, branching, and structured impact analysis

> 💡 The framework no longer depends on the legacy Sequential Thinking MCP server for its default reasoning flow.

## ⚡ Invoke Workflows

Your AI tool will automatically recognize the intent and trigger the appropriate workflow. You can use it in two ways:

#### ⚡ Method A: Slash Protocol (Explicit)
Directly type the command in the chat or editor to trigger the workflow.
- `/genesis` - Start project creation
- `/probe` - Analyze existing codebase risks
- `/blueprint` - Break down architecture into tasks

#### 🧠 Method B: Intent Protocol (Implicit)
Just speak naturally. Your AI tool will automatically select and run the right workflow.
- *"I want to start a new project for a todo app"* → Triggers `/genesis`
- *"Help me understand this legacy code and its risks"* → Triggers `/probe`
- *"I think there are gaps in this design, challenge it"* → Triggers `/challenge`
- *"The architecture is ready, let's plan the tasks"* → Triggers `/blueprint`
- *"Change the error message on the login page"* → Triggers `/change` (tweak existing task)
- *"I need to add a back-to-top button"* → Triggers `/genesis` (requires new task)

## 📦 Integrated: nexus-skills

Anws integrates **[nexus-skills](https://github.com/Haaaiawd/nexus-skills)** for codebase knowledge mapping:

- **nexus-mapper**: Analyzes repositories and generates `.nexus-map/` knowledge bases for AI cold-start
- **nexus-query**: Instant structural queries during active development

The `/probe` workflow leverages nexus-mapper's PROBE protocol for deep codebase analysis, detecting hidden risks, coupling hotspots, and architectural drift.
